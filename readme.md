## **Project Overview**
As part of the Bright Network Technology Academy, we were assigned a group project to research, plan and develop an API in less than a week. As a group, we wanted to create an API which we would want to use personally.

## **This API features:**
- One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships
- Derived queries and queries for multiple endpoints
- Full CRUD functionality

## **Table of Contents:**

## **Setup and Instructions for using the Project:**
1. Make sure that you have Java 17 installed to run BeatzNTA API
2. Clone this repository by typing the following command into your terminal:
   git clone git@github.com:HasmeetKaur/music-api.git
3. You can access the endpoints via an API platform such as Postman or through the browser at https://localhost:8080/{endpoint}

### **MVP:**
For our MVP, we wanted to create an API with full CRUD functionality.with 6x classes:

* User
* Playlist
* Artist
* Track
* Album

### **Extension:**

For our extension, we wanted to
* add a 'shuffle' button method to generate a randomised playlist.
* search tracks, albums, tracks

## **Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs):**
| POJO 	| Type 	| Input Structure 	|
|:---:	|---	|---	|
| Track 	| String name;<br>Artist artist;<br>Genre genre (Enum);<br>double length; 	| {<br>"name": "",<br>"artist": {    <br>     "id": Long,<br>     "name": "",<br>     "genre": ""<br>           },<br>"genre": "",<br>"length": double<br>} 	|
